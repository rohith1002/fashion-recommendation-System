# Fashion Recommendation System

## Overview

The Fashion Recommendation System is a deep learning project that uses a multi-input Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recommend outfits based on various input factors such as topwear, bottomwear, footwear, and occasion. The model's output is a rating value ranging from 0 to 1, indicating the suitability of the outfit.

In addition to the recommendation model, a web application has been developed that allows users to create and manage their virtual wardrobes. The application not only stores outfits but also provides features to suggest outfits based on occasions and find the next best outfits to wear.
